STEP 3 BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS - BEGINNER GUIDE
======================================================================

WHAT YOU'RE ADDING:
In this step, you'll add a Buzzer to your circuit.

COMPONENTS NEEDED FOR THIS STEP:
----------------------------------------
1. Arduino Uno
   - This is your microcontroller board
   - It has many pins for connecting components
2. LED (Light Emitting Diode)
   - This light will turn on/off when controlled
   - Has two legs: long leg is positive (+), short leg is negative (-)
3. Buzzer
   - Makes sound when electricity passes through it
   - Has two pins for positive and negative connections

TOOLS YOU'LL NEED:
--------------------
- Breadboard (for making connections)
- Jumper wires (various colors recommended)
- Wire strippers (if using solid core wire)
- USB cable (to power and program the Arduino)

SAFETY FIRST:
---------------
- Always disconnect power before making changes
- Double-check all connections before powering on
- Never connect power pins directly together
- Be gentle with components - they can be fragile

STEP-BY-STEP WIRING INSTRUCTIONS:
----------------------------------------
You are adding: Buzzer

WIRE CONNECTIONS TO MAKE:
------------------------------
CONNECTION 1:
   From: Arduino pin GND.2 (GND.2)
   To:   Buzzer pin 1 (Pin 1)
   Use:  BLACK wire (or any color you prefer)

CONNECTION 2:
   From: Arduino pin 3 (3)
   To:   Buzzer pin 2 (Pin 2)
   Use:  PURPLE wire (or any color you prefer)

IMPORTANT - RESISTOR CONNECTIONS:
-----------------------------------
A 220 ohm resistor has been automatically added for safety.
This resistor prevents too much current from damaging components.
The resistor goes between the Arduino pin and the component.

PLACEMENT TIPS:
---------------
- Place the Buzzer BELOW your Arduino
- Position it to the RIGHT side
- Keep wire connections neat and organized
- Use different colored wires for different types of connections
- Leave some space between components for easy access

TESTING YOUR CIRCUIT:
-------------------------
1. Double-check all connections match the instructions above
2. Make sure no wires are touching that shouldn't be
3. Connect power (USB cable to Arduino)
4. The buzzer will be silent until programmed
5. You'll need to upload code to make it beep

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
- If something doesn't work, disconnect power immediately
- Check that all wire connections are secure
- Verify you're using the correct pins
- Make sure components are oriented correctly
- For LEDs: long leg goes to positive, short leg to negative

CONGRATULATIONS!
---------------
You've completed building your circuit!
Now you can write code to control your components.
Check online tutorials for Arduino programming examples.
